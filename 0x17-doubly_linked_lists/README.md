# Overview #
The program codes contained in this directory are to help better understand doubly linked lists in C programming.

# General #
0. What is a doubly linked list?  
A doubly linked list contains an additional pointer that points from right to left.  

1. How to use doubly linked lists?  
A doubly linked list could be tranversed both forward and backward which makes it more efficient to insert or delete a node.    

# Quiz #
0. In a doubly linked list, what are possible directions to traverse it?  
Forward and backward  

1. In a doubly linked list, what’s the “head” of a linked list?  
It’s the node with the pointer to the previous equals to NULL.  

# Tasks #
0. Print list  
Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint\_t list.  

1. List length  
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint\_t list.  

2. Add node  
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint\_t list.  

3. Add node at the end  
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint\_t list.  

4. Free list  
Write a function that free a dlistint\_t list.  

5. Get node at index  
Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint\_t linked list.  

6. Sum list  
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint\_t linked list.  

7. Insert at index  
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.  

8. Delete at index   
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint\_t linked list.
