# Overview #
The program codes contained in this repository is to learn and understand C, specifically hash functions and hash tables.  

# General #
0. What is a hash function?  
A hash function is used to map data of unknown size to a value of a known size.  

1. What makes a good hash function?  
A good hash function considers and handles collisions.  

2. What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them?  
A hash table is a data structure used to retrieve data quickly and indexes large amount of data.  

3. What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table?  
A collision is when multiple data could fit into the same index.  This could be resolved through open addressing (aka linear probing) or close addressing (chaining).  

4. What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash table?  
The advantages of using a hash table is the speeding retrieval of data and reducing lookup costs.  The disadvantages are using a hash table for small amount of data, no efficient way to locate a value if its key is near a given key and it's collision prone.  

5. What are the most common use cases of hash tables?  
A hash table is usually used to implement associative arrays in Ruby, Python and PHP, database indexing and implementing caches, objects, static sets and dynamic sets.
